Project Name: Building a CRUD REST API with MySQL, Testing, and XML/JSON Output

Description:

The Building a CRUD REST API with MySQL, Testing, and XML/JSON Output project is aimed at developing a robust and scalable RESTful API that performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a MySQL database. The API provides endpoints to interact with the database, allowing users to create, retrieve, update, and delete data through HTTP requests. Additionally, the project includes testing functionality to ensure the API's reliability and accuracy. The API supports both XML and JSON formats for input and output data, providing flexibility for clients to choose their preferred format.l.
